## Daily Summary Visits
In 2009, the White House began publishing records of visitors. Over seven years, almost six million visitors were recorded. The csv file is merely a subset of the data set.

The data has also been cleaned and some columns removed, but the contents are untouched.

Below are the columns listed:

```name```: Name of visitor.

```appt_made_date```: Date and time appointment was created.

```appt_start_date```: Date and time appointment is scheduled to start.

```appt_end_date```: Date and time appointment is scheduled to end.

```visitee_namelast```: Last name of visitee (Last name of the person the visitor is meeting with).

```visitee_namefirst```: First name of visitee.

```meeting_room```: The room in which the appointment. is scheduled.

```description```: Optional comments added by the WAVES operator.

Note: The csv file, [potus_visitors_2015.csv](), can be found in this directory.
