### Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

## Overview
We're pretending that we are a data analyst for a company building Android and iOS mobile apps, which are available on the Google Play and the App Store. The main source of revenue comes from in-app ads. The more users that see and engage with ads, the better. The goal for this project to analyze data to help developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.
